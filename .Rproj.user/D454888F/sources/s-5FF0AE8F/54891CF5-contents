<!-- dplyr is a grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs that help you solve the most common data manipulation challenges: -->

<!-- * `mutate()` adds new variables that are functions of existing variables -->
<!-- * `select()` picks variables based on their names. -->
<!-- * `filter()` picks cases based on their values. -->
<!-- * `summarise()` reduces multiple values down to a single summary. -->
<!-- * `arrange()` changes the ordering of the rows. -->
