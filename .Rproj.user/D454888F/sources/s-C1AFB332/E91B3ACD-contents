This is the tutorial for implementing quality control procedure using the R package "QCwind". The quality control procedure is thoroughly introduced and discussed in the master thesis (\url{https://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/398742}) (or paper, cite), together with the R package "QCwind" that is built based on the procedure.  

In this tutorial, we focus on the wind speed observations by some citizen weather stations (CWS). The data is provided by Weather Observation Website (WOW-NL, \url{https://wow.knmi.nl/}), and we focus on the 39 CWS located in the province of Utrecht of the Netherlands.
