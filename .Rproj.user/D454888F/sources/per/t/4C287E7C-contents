## Analyse the mechanism behind WOW zero-inflated wind speed  

### Option 1: WOW wind sensors record low wind speeds as zero

Check the distribution of WOW zero wind speeds versus KNMI low wind speeds ($\leq$ 3 m/s):  

1. Compare quantities of zero wind speed records:  
  - by hour: more zeros during the nights than days;  
  - by day: no obvious trends;  
  - by month: more zeros in summer than winter;  
  - by year: no obvious trends;  
  - by date: behaving periodic every year.  

2. Analyse wind direction records when wind speeds are zero/low:  
  - WOW directions distribution during zero wind speeds should behave "similar" to overall wind directions distribution;  
  (Generally, in the Netherlands, more records in [190,260] overall, while more records in [110,190] during low wind speed. - summarised from De Bilt, Cabauw, and Eindhoven station.)  
  - The directions distribution should not have large differences in one direction.  
  
3. Look at wind gust records when wind speeds are zero/low:  
  - Wind gust records should be low or nearly zero.  



### Option 2: WOW wind sensors have obstructions from a certain direction

Analyse wind direction records when wind speeds are zero/low:  
  - The directions distribution have some large differences in a certain direction, compared to KNMI's.  
  


### Option 3: WOW wind sensors get stucked during heavy wind events

Look at wind gust records when wind speeds are zero/low:  
  - Wind gust records can achieve large values.
