#' @title The optimal order of stations to do spatial quality control
#' @description Finding the best order of candidate stations, based on the reliability
#' of reference stations; A station that has more official stations in the neighboring list
#' for reference would be checked first in the spatial quality control.
#' @param data a data.frame of observations by different stations, each
#' column represents a station, and the rows represent standard recording datetimes.
#' @param ref.data a data.frame that has the same settings with `data`; the stations
#' in `ref.data` are official stations used for reference.
#' @param geo.distance `TURE`/`FALSE`; The default is `FALSE`, which means the neighbors
#' selection function do not consider geographical distances between stations; If setting
#' `TRUE`, the longitude and latitude information of stations in `data` and `ref.data`
#' should be provided to calculate the geographical distances.
#' @return a list, each element contains the six choosen neighboring stations from either
#' `data` or `ref.data` for a candidate station in `data`.
